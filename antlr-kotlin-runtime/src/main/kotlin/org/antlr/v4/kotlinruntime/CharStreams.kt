/** This class represents the primary interface for creating [CharStream]s
 * from a variety of sources as of 4.7.  The motivation was to support
 * Unicode code points > U+FFFF.  [ANTLRInputStream] and
 * [ANTLRFileStream] are now deprecated in favor of the streams created
 * by this interface.
 *
 * DEPRECATED: `new ANTLRFileStream("myinputfile")`
 * NEW:        `CharStreams.fromFileName("myinputfile")`
 *
 * WARNING: If you use both the deprecated and the new streams, you will see
 * a nontrivial performance degradation. This speed hit is because the
 * [Lexer]'s internal code goes from a monomorphic to megamorphic
 * dynamic dispatch to get characters from the input stream. Java's
 * on-the-fly compiler (JIT) is unable to perform the same optimizations
 * so stick with either the old or the new streams, if performance is
 * a primary concern. See the extreme debugging and spelunking
 * needed to identify this issue in our timing rig:
 *
 * https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1781
 *
 * The ANTLR character streams still buffer all the input when you create
 * the stream, as they have done for ~20 years. If you need unbuffered
 * access, please note that it becomes challenging to create
 * parse trees. The parse tree has to point to tokens which will either
 * point into a stale location in an unbuffered stream or you have to copy
 * the characters out of the buffer into the token. That defeats the purpose
 * of unbuffered input. Per the ANTLR book, unbuffered streams are primarily
 * useful for processing infinite streams *during the parse.*
 *
 * The new streams also use 8-bit buffers when possible so this new
 * interface supports character streams that use half as much memory
 * as the old [ANTLRFileStream], which assumed 16-bit characters.
 *
 * A big shout out to Ben Hamilton (github bhamiltoncx) for his superhuman
 * efforts across all targets to get true Unicode 3.1 support for U+10FFFF.
 *
 * @since 4.7
